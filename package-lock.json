**How it works:** Webpack will be live compiling the SPA part "/project". Electron-Reload will consequently reload the BrowserWindow.
```bash
npm run serve:dev
```

Deploys the application with the properties in package.json to the plattform of the running host into a new directory called root under the root folder.  
**Note:** You need to have installed electron-packager globally to use this commmand
```bash
npm run deploy:host
```

## Creating an .exe Setup-Installer
It is recommended to use Inno Setup Wizard to get a single setup .exe file.  
After running the **npm run deploy:host** command create a folder named 'Data' and place the via electron-packager created folders there. Subsequently open the wizard add the  files and the Data Folder.  
Note: It is recommended to store in the UTF-8 with BOM encoding.
